# Flux_density_of_loop_windings
This project is aimed to visualize the effect of an arbitrary setting of current loops on the magnetic field intensity surrounding it.
## Notes
**WARNINGS** may appear at points too close to the current loop as a result of large round errors. These points tend to reach a singularity and approach infinity. To avoid this, change the z plane at which flux densities are computed or change the tol value.
